## About this app

#### Quotes maker

The main function of this app is to generate quotes by matching image `color`, `mood` and `theme` (optional) with quotes features.

- **Color Analysis:**  colors of the image uploaded by the user will be analyzed with algorithms modified from [`extcolors`](https://github.com/CairX/extract-colors-py) (a Python module for extracting colors from an image) 
- **Feature Matching:** mood and theme selected by the user will be used to match the sentiment and theme tags of quotes

#### **Quote of the day** 

Our app also displays a randomly-picked popular quote every day by using the date as the seed.

## Data

- `all_quotes_w_sentimentalScore.csv`
  - quote text, author, tags, and popularity are from [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes)
  - sentiment tags are generated by sentimental analysis using [`NLTK sentiment Vader`](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/sentiment/vader.html)

- `color_tag.csv`
  - color and color tags are referenced from [The Meaning Behind Colors](https://medium.com/re-write/the-meaning-behind-colors-decadca7cb15)
  - tags are cleaned by finding synonyms using [`NLTK Wordnet`](https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/corpus/reader/wordnet.html)
